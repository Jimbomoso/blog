Example post: 

This is a simple app I built to play around with an API. The app is written in **JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML**. 

- [**Demo**](https://jimbomoso.github.io/lameProgrammingJokes/)
- [**Code**](https://github.com/Jimbomoso/lameProgrammingJokes) 

### Features:

- Utilizes 15Dkatz's offical joke API ([repo](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api))
- Async/await keywords 
- Event listeners
- A hidden CSS class that controls which buttons are visible at which times
- Fetch API 

### What I learned: 

- The aysnc/await keywords allow the function to pause running until the promise settles yet in an easier to write/understand syntax.
