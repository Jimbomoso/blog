### What I learned: 

- Model - Stuff that interacts with fetching data 
    - where data is stored
- View - Templates
- Controller - Traffic cop between view and model
- middleware - allows actions to be taken between the request and the response
- mongoose is a package for Node for interfacing with Mongodb
- do data normalization as close to model as possible
