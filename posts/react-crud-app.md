This is a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) app built using **React**, **Skeleton CSS** and the **Random User Generator API**. The app is a basic user management dashboard. On first load the app grabs a list of 5 user names from the API and loads them as existing users. Once loaded you have the ability to add, edit and delete users. If you choose to edit a user, the add user section morphs into an edit user section.
