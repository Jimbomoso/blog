This is a simple app I built to meet the requirements of a freeCodeCamp front end certification project. The app uses **React** and **Bootstrap**.

- [**Demo**](https://jimbomoso.github.io/random-quote/)
- [**Code**](https://github.com/Jimbomoso/random-quote) 

### Features:

- Quotes sourced from simple Database.js file containing an array
- Event listeners for the buttons; one grabs a random quote, one shares quote to twitter
- Uses Math.random to randomize quote selection 

### What I learned: 

- Rapid prototyping with create-react-app
- React state management
