### What is GraphQL? 

An open-source data query langage 

#### Technically:

GraphQL is a standardized data query language that is used by applications to communicate with APIs.

#### Non-technically:

GraphQL is a language that applications can use to make requests for information from external resources of information.

GraphQL is basically a standardized way for an application to specify what data it wants to receive and how it would like to receive it to a different  piece of software that was designed for processing the requests. These pieces of software are called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 

At a high level, an API is designed to do two things: 

1. To provide a way for external sources to access stored information 

2.   To process the requests made for the information from the resource

In summary, GraphQL is a langauge that applications can talk to external information resources in to explain what data they are seeking and how they would like to receive said data back.
