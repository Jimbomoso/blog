### Deciphering GraphQL:

GraphQL is wildy popular and there are endless amounts of articles and tutorials raving about it. The purpose of this post isn't to recreate what is already out there, it is to fill in what is often missing; a basic explaination of what GraphQL is. It is not difficult to find an explantion, but most attempts seem to contain a bunch of jargon that assumes a lot of prior knowledge, and/or more reason to use it than explaination of what it is. This post is for anyone looking for a basic, jargon-free explanation of what GraphQL is. 

### Generically: 

An open-source data query langage. 

#### Technically:

GraphQL is a standardized data query language that is used by applications to communicate with APIs.

#### Non-technically:

GraphQL is a language that applications can use to make requests for information from external resources of information.

GraphQL is basically a standardized way for an application to specify what data it wants to receive and how it would like to receive it to a different  piece of software that was designed for processing the requests. These pieces of software are called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 

At a high level, an API is designed to do two things: 

1. To provide a way for external sources to access stored information 

2. To process the requests made for the information from the resource

In summary, GraphQL is a langauge that applications can talk to external information resources in to explain what data they are seeking and how they would like to receive said data back.
